* julia-repl-vterm-mode.el

The julia-repl-vterm-mode.el provides a major-mode for inferior [[https://julialang.org/][Julia]] process that runs in [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]], and a minor-mode that extends [[https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs][julia-mode]] for interaction with the inferior Julia process.

** Why?

There's already [[https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl][julia-repl]]. It works well in most cases, but I sometimes encountered small problems when I handle very large DataFrame, which seemed to be caused by the limited performance of term.el. I wrote this simple REPL mode using vterm and found the performance problems were resolved.

** Should I use this?

This code was made for my personal use. It has only the minimum functions that I need. I recommend any general users to use julia-repl instead. The julia-repl seems also going to support vterm soon.
